The Transparency Setter plugin allows you to apply transparency to both vector and raster layers, as well as layers within selected groups in the Layer Panel in QGIS.
Here's a summary of its behavior:

Initialization:
The plugin adds a toolbar to the QGIS interface called "Layer Transparency Toolbar".
The toolbar contains a label ("Transparency:"), a slider, and a spin box.
The initial transparency value is set to 0, and the slider and spin box range from 0 to 100 with a step size of 10.

Applying Transparency:
When you change the slider value or manually enter a value in the spin box, the transparency is updated accordingly.
The transparency is applied to the selected layers or groups in the Layer Panel.

Layer Selection:
If you select one or more layers in the Layer Panel, the transparency is applied to those layers individually.
If you select one or more groups in the Layer Panel, the transparency is applied to the layers within the selected groups.
If you select a combination of layers and groups, the transparency is applied to both the individual layers and the layers within the selected groups.

Group Selection:
If you select a group in the Layer Panel, the transparency is updated based on the transparency values of the layers within that group.
If all layers within the group have the same transparency value, the slider and spin box will display that value.
If the layers within the group have different transparency values, the slider and spin box will display the transparency value of the first selected layer, and the spin box text will be highlighted in red to indicate inconsistency.

Usage Examples:
Example 1: Selecting a single layer and setting transparency to 50. The transparency of that layer will be set to 50.
Example 2: Selecting multiple layers and setting transparency to 30. The transparency of each selected layer will be set to 30.
Example 3: Selecting a group and setting transparency to 30. The transparency of all the layers in the group (also the ones in subgroups) will be set to 30.
Example 4: Selecting a group with layers having different transparency values. The slider and spin box will display the transparency value of the first selected layer, and the spin box text will be highlighted in red.
Example 5: Selecting a group with layers having the same transparency value. The slider and spin box will display that transparency value.
Remember that the plugin only applies transparency to the layers/groups that are currently selected in the Layer Panel.

Code Structure:
The TransparencySetter class is the main plugin implementation. It handles the initialization, GUI creation, and transparency application logic.
The class constructor initializes the plugin and sets up the necessary attributes and translations.
The tr method is a helper method for translating strings using the Qt translation API.
The add_action method adds a toolbar icon to the plugin toolbar.
The initGui method is called to create the menu entries and toolbar icons inside the QGIS GUI.
The unload method removes the plugin menu item and icon from the QGIS GUI.
The apply_transparency method applies the specified transparency value to the selected layers or groups.
The apply_transparency_to_group method applies the transparency value to layers within a given group.
The apply_transparency_to_layer method applies the transparency value to a specific layer.
The update_slider_from_selected_layer method updates the slider value based on the currently selected layer or group in the layer panel.
The update_slider_from_layer_node method updates the slider value based on the transparency of a selected layer.
The update_slider_from_group_node method updates the slider value based on the transparency of a selected group.
The get_transparency_values_from_group method retrieves the transparency values of all layers within a given group.
The slider_changed method handles slider value changes and updates the transparency.
The spin_box_changed method handles spin box value changes and updates the transparency.
The run method is no longer needed as the slider directly handles the transparency.
The SteppedSlider class is a custom QSlider class that supports stepping slider values. It overrides the mouseMoveEvent method to snap the slider value to the nearest step.
